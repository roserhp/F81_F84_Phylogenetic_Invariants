F84_nep.sage computes the rank of Jacobian, at the no-evolution point, of the 38 equations given in Theorem 7.3 of the paper. This computation is used in the proof of the theorem, and referenced in it.

F84QuartetIdeals.ipynb verifies Corollary 7.5 computationally by computing the ideals involved and showing the relvant equality and containment.  

F81_nep.sage computes the rank of Jacobian, at the no-evolution point, of the 7 equations given in Theorem 7.6. This computation is used once again in the proof of the theorem.

F81QuartetIdeals.ipynb verifies Theorem 7.6 and Corollary 7.8 computationally by computing the ideals involved and showing the relevant equalities and containment.
