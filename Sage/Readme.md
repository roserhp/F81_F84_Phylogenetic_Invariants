F84_nep.sage computes the rank of Jacobian, at the no-evolution point, of the 38 equations given in Theorem 7.3 of the paper. This computation is used in the proof of the theorem, and referenced in it.

F81_nep.sage computes the rank of Jacobian, at the no-evolution point, of the 7 equations given in Theorem 7.6. This computation is used once again in the proof of the theorem.
